      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered the new hobby of astrophotography, although I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of the gear, I try to grab every opportunity to get a photo. Recently one of those opportunities came by, I rented a camera and the lens and went to the location. This post I&amp;rsquo;ll go through the process of taking these types of photos and what mistakes I made. (this was a first time experience for me too).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Fourier series is a mathematical concept which was developed by the French mathematician Jean-Baptiste Fourier in the early 19th century. He engraved his name in the mathematics hall of fame with the groundbreaking discovery of Fourier series.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fourier&amp;rsquo;s key insight was that any function could be decomposed into a sum of sine and cosine waves with different amplitudes and frequencies. This discovery laid the foundation many areas science like physics, telecommunication etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
